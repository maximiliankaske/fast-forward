If you are using the `npm` widget, the screenshot button is included an your user’s screenshots will be uploaded to cloudinary. If you’re creating your own widget, you’ll need to take care about the uploads and pass the ‘screenshotURL’ to the feedbacks body post request. If you’re creating your own widget, checkout packages like “html-to-image” or “html2canvas” for such functionality.
