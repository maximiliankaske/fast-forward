# Fast Forward

**An easy way to allow your users to give feedback**

> This project is in the experimental stage. If you have any questions, please contact: maximilian@kaske.org

## Demo

[fast-forward.app](https://fast-forward.app)

## Todo

- [ ] Move Thumbnail into Form Component (to better reset image on successful submit)
- [ ] Create a `fast-forward-[widget]` npm package for easy integration
- [ ] self-hosted documentation - [plausible.io example](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting)
- [ ] Rework `/lib/api` using more generic types (currently only string) and make the fields not mandatory. If undefined, return every property.
- [ ] Add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` props to firebase
- [ ] Use `_middleware` to instead of `@/lib/middleware`
- [ ] Missing firebase rules on prod
- [ ] Make the templates shareable and public to the world.

## Ideas

- [ ] Replace Firebase with Supabase or Planetscale & Prisma
